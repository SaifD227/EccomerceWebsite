                <p>E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It has revolutionized the way businesses operate and consumers shop by providing a convenient, fast, and accessible platform for transactions. E-commerce platforms enable customers to browse products, compare prices, read reviews, and make purchases from the comfort of their homes, often with a wider variety of options than physical stores. Businesses benefit from reduced operational costs, a broader reach to global markets, and the ability to personalize marketing and services through data analytics. The growth of mobile technology and secure payment systems has further accelerated the expansion of e-commerce, making it an integral part of the modern economy.</p>
